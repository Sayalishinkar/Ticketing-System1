   <div class="a">We are group of students from SNJB's Late Sau. KBJ College of Engineering, Chandwad , Trying to provide a software platform for our College.
    Our aim is to find solutions for problems that are arising at the college level. To get the solution of  any issue, teachers have to post their issues on Whats- App group or to communicate with each other through call.It's very time consuming. Sometimes, to whom we want to assign the particular task may occur certain distractions. By using ticketing system, It becomes easy to assign the  tickets to the right person and get the solution quickly.
